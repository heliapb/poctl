# Analyze Command

The analyze command is used to examine Prometheus Operator objects to ensure they comply with specific rules. It checks whether the objects meet certain predefined conditions.

```bash mdox-exec="go run main.go analyze --help" mdox-expect-exit-code=0
Analyzes the given object and runs a set of rules on it to determine if it is compliant with the given rules.
		For example:
			- Analyze if the service monitor is selecting any service or using the correct service port.

Usage:
  poctl analyze [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help               help for analyze
  -k, --kind string        The kind of object to analyze. For example, ServiceMonitor
  -n, --name string        The name of the object to analyze
  -s, --namespace string   The namespace of the object to analyze

Global Flags:
      --kubeconfig string   path to the kubeconfig file, defaults to $KUBECONFIG
      --log-format string   Log format (default "text")
      --log-level string    Log level (default "DEBUG")
```

## Analyze ServiceMonitor

The analyze command can specifically target a ServiceMonitor object within a Kubernetes cluster. Users can specify the namespace and name of the ServiceMonitor to assess its compliance with the predefined rules.

## Rules

The analyze command evaluates objects against a set of rules to determine compliance. These rules are defined in the `analyzer` package and are specifically implemented in the `internal/analyzer/servicemonitor.go` file.

### ServiceMonitor Existence

The ServiceMonitor object must exist in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Selector Presence

The ServiceMonitor object must have a defined selector that selects at least one service.

### Port Matching

Each endpoint within the ServiceMonitor object must have a defined port, and this port should match the port of the service it monitors.
